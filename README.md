Solar System Explorer 🌌🪐

An interactive and visually immersive Solar System Explorer built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON data architecture. This project allows users to explore planets, moons, dwarf planets, space missions, and the history of our solar system through animations, dynamic visualizations, and detailed scientific information.

The goal of this project was to combine creative UI design with educational content to create an engaging learning experience while demonstrating advanced front-end development skills.


✨ Features

• Explore detailed information about the Sun and all eight planets
• Interactive 3D orbital visualization using HTML Canvas
• Advanced planet comparison tool
• Search, filter, and sort planets dynamically
• Detailed modal view with scientific characteristics and fun facts
• Dark and Light mode with saved preferences (Local Storage)
• Hero particle animation and animated cosmic background
• Notable moons and dwarf planets section
• Solar system regions like Asteroid Belt and Kuiper Belt
• Historic, active, and future space missions timeline
• Fully responsive design for different screen sizes


🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 — Semantic structure and layout
CSS3 — Glassmorphism UI, animations, responsive design
JavaScript (Vanilla JS) — Dynamic rendering, canvas animation, filtering, comparison logic
JSON — Structured solar system scientific dataset


📂 Project Structure

Solar-System-Explorer

index.html — Main application layout
style.css — Styling, animations, and themes
script.js — Application logic and interactivity
data.json — Solar system dataset

 🚀 How To Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Use Live Server Extension or any local server to run the project.
4. Open index.html in your browser.

Running through a local server is recommended because the application loads data using a JSON fetch request.


🌍 What You Can Explore

• Planetary physical characteristics and orbital information
• Atmosphere, temperature, gravity, and composition data
• Major moons and ring systems
• Space exploration missions from past to future
• Solar system formation timeline


💡 Purpose of the Project

This project was created to practice advanced front-end concepts such as:

• DOM manipulation
• Data-driven UI rendering
• Canvas animation
• Responsive layouts
• Theme persistence
• Modular structured data handling

It also aims to make space science interactive and easier to understand for learners and enthusiasts.
